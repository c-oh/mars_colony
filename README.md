This project was generated with Angular2. As one of my first Angular2 projects, I was able to learn how to display user created contentent through API's provided, and understand the logic/reasoning of the frameworks.

## Difficulties:
At first, it was difficult to understand how Angular2 works because of its confusing file names and constructor connections. However, after pratice and looking up tutorial videos, I haven now grasped the basics, and even foundations of how Angular2 works.

## Skills used:

HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, Lint

## Improvement for the future (in progress):
Perhaps the CSS could be improved on.
